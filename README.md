This is project that uses [opensource coincap api’s](https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets) to fetch the list of cryptocurrencies and render them in a table like the original website.
I have also applied pagination with page size 50 i.e., only 50 currencies are visible in the table initially and next 50 loads on clicking the ‘load more’ button.
